# PlayerConfigSelection
The application was written in order to filter saves for Skyrim characaters based on the characaters name. When playing Skyrim I've created a number of characters and it is very time consuming going through a large list of saves to find a character I might have played with months ago. This program tries to keep my eyes from glazing over.
